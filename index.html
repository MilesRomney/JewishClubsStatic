                Mountain View’s Jewish Student Club is for Jewish students, sure, but it’s also for all students who recognize the seeds of their own faith in Judaism, or the values that built Western civilization, or have an interest in history or international relations, or who just want to hang with a pretty chill crowd.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Judaism is a religion, but more than that, it’s a people, and a culture, and values and traditions, and a language, and a crazy, fascinating history of dispersion and reunification, tragedy and triumph, of nearly being exterminated over and over, but rising from the ashes every time. Judaism is over 3,500 years old, and is the world’s oldest surviving ethnocultural group. The club is meant to be a bridge between peoples, a forum for cultural exchange, and in the grand tradition of Judaism, a supportive space for good-faith argument as well.
